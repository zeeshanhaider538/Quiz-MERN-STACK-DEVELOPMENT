Arrow funtions:
    Arrow function you can skip the return keyword.
    Arrow function can be a single line.
    Function is stored in a variable without typing keyword function;
    this is best for callbacks or for map , filter, reduce and forEach
    Example:
            const add=((a,b)=> a+b);




Regular Function:
    Regular functions have always used return keyword to return the value.
    But regular functions can not be a single line.
    there should be written keyword Function for declaring a function with it.
    this is best for object methods.
    Example:
            Function add(a,b)
            {
                return a+b;
            }
